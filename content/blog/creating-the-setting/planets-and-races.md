The planets inside the asteroid belt have the same names as the ones in our solar system. But in One Shot RPG they’re quite different. Each is home to a different alien species, and each features its own array of flora and fauna. There’s also a mysterious fourth alien race that may hold the secret to Pluto.<!--more-->

## The Planets
The one shot adventures primarily take place in the space between Mercury and the asteroid belt. The planets players will be exploring are [different than the planets we remember, and feature alien life](/blog/creating-the-setting/better-elevator-pitch/#adding-interest). The character’s space ships can travel from [one planet to an adjacent one in about a day](/blog/creating-the-setting/technology-and-the-military/#spaceships). Each planet is home to a different alien civilization and ecosystem, providing the players with something new to discover and explore.

## Mercury
Mercury is too hot a planet to properly colonize. Instead it has been converted into a massive power generator and server farm that powers the future Internet. Presumably the advanced technology that runs the information network doesn’t generate heat (or works more effectively in hot environments). The planet is mostly automated machinery with a military base to protect it. Players will likely not be spending time visiting Mercury.

## Venus
The Venus on One Shot RPG is not the hot, greenhouse gas-covered planet that we know. Instead it is terraformed, with water, alien plants, alien animals, and an intelligent alien species. Like how our [Venus is similar to Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus), the Venus of One Shot RPG feels the most Earth-like. Instead of green plants, though, this new planet features mainly yellow, gold, and orange flora.

The alien species that calls Venus home looks like anthropomorphic versions of Earth animals, only fiercer. Humans refer to this species as “animal people” as a simplified term. Likewise the fauna resembles mixtures and variations of Earth animals. The plants share the same structures and biology as Earth flora. It’s theorized that a meteor struck Earth a long time ago, forcing debris out into space. This debris contained micro-organisms which could survive the vacuum. Eventually this debris and organisms landed on Venus and evolved in the same manner as Earth’s species, which would explain the similarities.

## Earth
Earth is divided up into six nations and one military state, which roughly follow the boundaries of the continents. Instead of being controlled by governments---borders are useless when you can fly to other worlds---the nations are defined by the largest corporation in that area. A person’s “citizenship” is dictated by which companies they choose to spend their money with, rather than geography. Because each corporation owns all of the land and services in that area, most people choose to spend their money with the company that operates where they live, thus creating the “nations”. There is a sense of public good, government, and law, it just happens that they answer to shareholders. The military is its own nation, based out of what we would call Antarctica. They also lay claim to all of the moon colonies in the solar system.

## Mars
Mars is a planet of stone, caverns, dense vegetation, gemstones, and fungus. From space it appears red with giant green lines---roots---weaving their way through the surface. On the ground, the red stone is dotted with vast caverns that stretch miles deep into the crust. The surface is mostly dry and uninhabited, there are no oceans like Earth and Venus. The few surface civilizations follow the giant roots, which carry water like pipelines. Mars is an underground planet, most people live in the caverns where mist is trapped, leading to precipitation and underground lakes and rivers. The vegetation and fungus is dense inside the caverns, and many of the flora glow with every color of light. All plants share the vast root system that lines the planet, sharing water and nutrients.

The alien civilization that calls Mars home are a mixture of living stone and plant. The same species can range from being entirely made of stone, to entirely plant matter, to a mixture of the two. The race has symbiotically evolved with fungus species, and many individuals feature glowing patches of fungus. The lesser fauna of Mars also range from fully stone, to fully plant, and some are entirely fungus. The humans of Earth refer to all natives of Mars as “rock monsters,” “plant monsters,” or "mushroom monsters".

## Asteroid Belt
The asteroid belt is home to the cosmic horrors. The military has blocked access (as best as they can) and characters are advised not to travel through it. The military will not rescue any civilian ship that tries to make its way through the belt.

## Pluto
Pluto, which now located between the asteroid belt and Jupiter, isn’t a dwarf planet. Instead it’s a giant warp gate that’s releasing cosmic horrors into the solar system. Not much else is known about it, such as how it works or what it’s made of.

## The New Fourth Race
Shortly before Pluto revealed itself, a new race of intelligent aliens were discovered living on the three inhabited planets. They’re tight-lipped about where they come from, claiming they don’t remember. But, they’re peaceful and are eager to integrate into society. The species is made of living metal. They’re not robots or androids---like humans try to claim they are---they are sapient. Their appearance can be unsettling, and they share some visual similarities to the cosmic horrors and scummed. There are rumors that they are related to the monsters infesting the solar system, and that they know the truth behind scum and warp technology.
