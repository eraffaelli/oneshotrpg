## Small Tweaks
- Added a rollover to props so they stand out and signal they're interactible
- Changes to shields, making them more than a pure damage sponge. Now with counterplay
- Players are able to manage their upgrades and weapons after losing a battle before it restarts
- Added different types of quest progression: quests that show all their objectives at once, and quests that objectives one at a time in order
