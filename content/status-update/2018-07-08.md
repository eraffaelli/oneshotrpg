## Site Updates
Made a lot of tweaks to the site, knowing full well that [tomorrow there's going to be a huge Hugo update](https://gohugo.io/news/lets-celebrate-hugos-5th-birthday/). That update can wait a few weeks though.

- Created the status updates section
- Updated the front page to better reflect what's being made
- Configured the privacy settings
- Update Hugo and dependencies
