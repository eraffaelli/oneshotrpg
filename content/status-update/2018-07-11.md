## Path to Next Alpha

There's a long road to the next alpha, but tasks have been created, sorted, and started.

- Initial creation of placeholder areas, rooms, props, quests, and items for this alpha
- Add a drag threshold to prop interactions so the player can scroll the camera without worrying about misclicking on a prop
- Limit the camera scrolling so you can't scroll past a background
- Create a screen/viewport manager to better control resolution
- Remember the camera position of each room. You can switch rooms and come back with the camera pointed at the door you used
- Readded the set_flag script command
